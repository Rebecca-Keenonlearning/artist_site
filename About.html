                <h3 class="text-white display-4">Painter from France</h3>
                <p class="text-white fs-3">Monet was raised in Le Havre, Normandy, and became interested in
                    the
                    outdoors
                    and
                    drawing from an early
                    age. Although his mother, Louise-Justine Aubrée Monet, supported his ambitions to be a painter, his
                    father, Claude-Adolphe, disapproved and wanted him to pursue a career in business. He was very close
                    to
                    his mother, but she died in January 1857 when he was sixteen years old, and he was sent to live with
                    his
                    childless, widowed but wealthy aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.</p>
                <p class="text-white fs-3">He went on to study at the Académie Suisse, and under the academic
                    history
                    painter
                    Charles Gleyre, where
                    he was a classmate of Auguste Renoir. His early works include landscapes, seascapes, and portraits,
                    but
                    attracted little attention. A key early influence was Eugène Boudin who introduced him to the
                    concept of
                    plein air painting. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, also in northern France, where he purchased a
                    house and property and began a vast landscaping project, including a water-lily pond.</p>
